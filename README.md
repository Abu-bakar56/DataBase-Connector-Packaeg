# Python Project Template

This project is structured to support both production and development environments with a focus on clean code, testing, and configuration management.

## Installation

### Production
Install the production dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development
For development and testing, install the development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

### Differences Between `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt`
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains dependencies required to run the production code.
- **`requirements_dev.txt`**: Contains additional dependencies for development and testing.

## Testing

This project uses `tox` for testing across multiple Python versions.

### `tox.ini`
- **Purpose**: Testing against different Python versions.
- **How It Works**:
  - Creates isolated environments using `.tox`
  - Installs dependencies and packages
  - Runs specified commands
- Combines functionalities of `virtualenvwrapper` and `makefile`.

### `pyproject.toml`
- **Purpose**: Configuration of the Python project, an alternative to `setup.cfg`.
- **Contains**: Configuration related to the build system, such as package name, version, author, license, and dependencies.

### `setup.cfg`
- **Purpose**: Used by `setuptools` to configure packaging and installation.

## Testing Python Applications

### Types of Testing
- **Automated Testing**
- **Manual Testing**

### Modes of Testing
- **Unit Testing**
- **Integration Testing**

### Testing Frameworks
- **pytest**
- **unittest**
- **robotframework**
- **selenium**
- **behave**
- **doctest**

## Code Style and Syntax Checking

Ensure adherence to coding standards using the following tools:
- **pylint**
- **flake8** (includes `pylint`, `pycodestyle`, `mccabe`)
- **pycodestyle**
